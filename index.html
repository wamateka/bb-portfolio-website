              provides the full form of most if not all commonly used
              abbreviations. It runs in a terminal as I decided not to compile
              it into an executable file to minimize its resource usage.

              This is a traditional blackjack game I developed using Python. It
              is a one player against the dealer version of the classic, which
              runs in a terminal. After hitting the run button the user is asked
              how many games they want to play and the game begins.

                public hospitals, through various programs such as providing
                them with food, soap, and other life necessities, entertaining
                children in designated areas to allow hospitalized parents to
                rest, interacting with the patients for morale, and assisting
                them in reintegrating the society by equipping them with skills
                such as sewing knowledge. Volunteering at Nacham Africa is an
                enriching experience as It brings to me a different perspective
                of life, one through the eyes of the most destitute. It has
                taught me to always be humble, grateful, and most importantly,
                compassionate.

          I am a patient and hardworking person,fascinated by the operation of

          me to individually learning and experiencing different programming
          languages and technologies. I aspire to one day apply my skills and
          knowledge in the digitization of Burundi and other developing areas so
          as to create a more inclusive digital future.

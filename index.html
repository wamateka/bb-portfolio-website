          <h3>Internship</h3>
          <p>
            Last summer, of 2023, i Interned At Mediabox, One of the best tech companies in Burundi, as part of a Work
            experience Program at school. For 3 months, not only did i learn, but i was also able to apply the
            different knowledge i had in different technologies. Strating the first month by producing
            functional specification for different projects at Mediabox, in French, a language i did not master, allowed
            me
            to understand how projects are designed in big Enterprises. In the second Month, i delved into IoT's.
            Finally
            a more technical job for me. I was not really familiarised with electonics, but playing around with The
            different IoT devices
            broadened my knowledge on how this technologies can be used to make life better and more effecient. I
            concivied a small security system
            using ultrasonic sensor and Arduino, which were programed using c++. just to say a few. I ended the
            Internship with A hands on experience on
            a green-house automation project where i contributed in programming stepper motors to lift the plastic sheeting used to cover the 
            green House to allow more air to get in during hot weather.
            The image shows when we were in the control center testing the code with the person in charge of person(in black t shirt) in charge the green-house project.

            we trained for
            interschools football competitions. I was playing as the Goalkeeper forThe King's school football team. This
            Image depicts the day
            when we were awarded the cup as <b>Winners</b> Of the <b>Youth Cup Burundi</b>. I am the second person from

            I was also part of The drama and dance clud in GIA(Gitega International Academy).
            We orchastrated different plays and dance choreographies at different occasions like The GIA day
            (The day GIA was founded), MDD competition, chapel services. As a Christian school, everything was Christ
            centered
            and directed to send a message to the audiance. Here is a link to

              <p>
                During the summer, I usually volunteer at Nacham Africa, a
                non-governmental organization that cares for the uncared for in
                public hospitals, through various programs such as providing
                them with food, soap, and other life necessities, entertaining
                children in designated areas to allow hospitalized parents to
                rest, interacting with the patients for morale, and assisting
                them in reintegrating the society by equipping them with skills
                such as sewing knowledge. Volunteering at Nacham Africa is an
                enriching experience as It brings to me a different perspective
                of life, one through the eyes of the most destitute. It has
                taught me to always be humble, grateful, and most importantly,
                compassionate.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a patient and hardworking person,fascinated by the operation of
        computers and programs. I recently graduated from Gitega International
        Academy, where I took science (physics) as my major. I've always had a
        passion for technology and all the ways it can be leveraged, which led
        me to individually learning and experiencing different programming
        languages and technologies. I aspire to one day apply my skills and
        knowledge in the digitization of Burundi and other developing areas so
        as to create a more inclusive digital future.
